On the auspicious occasion of Rath Yatra, the National Service Scheme (NSS) unit of NIT Jamshedpur extends heartfelt wishes to all. Rath Yatra, also known as the Festival of Chariots(actually it is a sanskrit word made from Rath and Yatra which means Chariot and Journey respectively), is one of the most celebrated festivals in India, particularly in Puri, Odisha, dedicated to Lord Jagannath, along with his siblings Lord Balabhadra and Goddess Subhadra.

The festival symbolizes the annual journey of Lord Jagannath from his temple to the Gundicha temple, signifying unity, devotion, and the celebration of cultural heritage. The grand chariot procession reflects inclusiveness, as people from all walks of life come together in service and faith.

At NSS NIT Jamshedpur, we embrace this spirit of unity, service, and devotion. The Rath Yatra reminds us of the importance of selfless service, humility, and compassion — values that resonate with the core ideals of NSS. It inspires us to stay grounded, serve society with dedication, and walk together toward a better and more inclusive future.

As we celebrate this divine journey, let us carry forward the message of peace, togetherness, and service in our daily lives.

Jai Jagannath!

— NSS NIT Jamshedpur
